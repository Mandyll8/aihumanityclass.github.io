## News: Chinese Drills Around Taiwan (Team 1)


The news team led the class with a debrief on China’s military drills near Taiwan. On December 29, 2025, China launched Justice Mission 2025, a series of military drills in the South China Sea surrounding Taiwan. These drills represent an escalation in tensions between China and Taiwan and its allies, Japan, South Korea, and the United States.

With dozens of naval vessels and aircraft, China conducted live fire, search-and-destroy operations, designating seven operational zones, disrupting Taiwanese air travel. Of the operation, Chinese officials stated they were necessary to “safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity.”

Since the Chinese Civil War in 1949, mainland China, led by the CCP, has claimed ownership of Taiwan, led by the Nationalists. Over the past 20 years, China has become more imposing due to Taiwan’s increasing economic and strategic value. With TSMC, Taiwan produces over 95% of global advanced chips, which are critical for modern AI infrastructure. 

These operations are also in response to international political updates. The US announced an arms deal earlier in the month. The deal, worth $11 billion,  grants Taiwan access to high-mobility artillery rocket systems, HIMARS. Also, Japan’s new prime minister had announced in November that aggression towards Taiwan would be seen as a threat against Japan.

In January 2026, the U.S. announced a trade deal with Taiwan. Taiwan committed to invest $250 billion in semiconductor and technology manufacturing in the U.S. The deal will bring 40% of Taiwan’s supply chain and chip-making to the U.S., lowering American reliance on Taiwan, especially in the case of Chinese annexation. This deal may incentivise China to control the island before more assets are relocated while concurrently weakening Taiwan’s leverage in security negotiations with the U.S.

The news team concluded that these events stress how control over chip manufacturing is essentially control over who can build powerful AI. Thus, the expansion and progression of AI and supply chains are inseparable from geopolitics.

The class was then opened for discussion. In response to a question about identifying a shift in Taiwan-China relations, specifically due to semiconductors, the news team noted a decrease in global tensions, as of last April to early fall. But, Trump’s recent pushes for deregulation signaled a silent AI war with China. 

Amodei referenced his idea of global powers forming AI political coalitions. How important could Taiwan be in this?

One classmate connected the U.S. and China tensions to our AI 2027 readings, questioning the possibility of imminent war with China. In response, the news team highlighted the structure of the Justice Mission drills, in which China encircled Taiwan with their navy and had air forces above, as if to protect it from outside military forces. However, a few classmates seemed skeptical of the concept of a modern war.

Another student was concerned about possible bias in the authors, given that one of their sources was from the New York Times, which tends to have some anti-Chinese sentiments. [insert specific article reference for this]

The focus on Taiwan led to questions about the true reason why TSMC is so far ahead in the semiconductor industry. While it is difficult to pinpoint a singular reason or strained resource for their success, Professor Evan emphasized their early origins and investments and access to AMSL Dutch machines for production. Still, since other chip production companies also have access to such machines, Evans said he was still unsure as to how TMSC blows the competition out of the water.


This is _italics_ and **bold**. You can use latex math, but probably won't need to for this blog.

To include an image, store the image file in src/content/static/images/. Then, use

If you have other files to include, put them in static/docs.

You shouldn't need to change the layouts or other files, but if you want to improve them without breaking things, that's fine.
